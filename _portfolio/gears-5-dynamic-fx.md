In Gears 5, we devised a system to handle character effects through data assets. I built the code back-end to support artist create-able dynamic effects. Our lead technical vfx artist James Sharpe built an atomic multi-purpose material function to go with the code system that would allow for a variety of effects to be created at no additional shader cost.

Almost all of the character effects applied in the game went through this new system.
