For the GEARS 5 DLC expansion "Hivebusters" I was tasked to help bring our hummingbird inspired Predator to life. One issue was our design required the creature be able to hover, so making such a large creature look like it was believably hovering was difficult.

A lot of experimentation went into the best way to effectively fake the motion-blur created by wings moving at such high speed.

The end solution, however, was quite simple. Large figure-eight translucent cards attached to each wing, with a scrolling pre-blurred texture. More information on how this effect was achieved (and some of the experiments that ended up not working out)

(Special shout outs to the amazing character, animators, and vfx teams involved in bringing this amazing creature to life.)
